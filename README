       data via K-means and density peak finding, Manuscript, 2012

2 Overview
     We combine the ideas from the finite mixture model and histogram spatial
     exploration together to find the clustering of the flow cytometry data. This new
     algorithm, in which we called flowPeaks, can be applied to high dimensional
     data and identify irregular shape clusters. The algorithm first uses K-means
     algorithm with a large K to partition the population into many compact clusters.
     These partitioned data allow us to generate a smoothed density function. All
     local peaks are exhaustedly found by exploring the density function and the
     cells are clustered by the associated local peak. The algorithm fowPeaks is
     automatic, fast and reliable and robust to the cluster shape and outliers. Details
     can be seen in the paper by Ge (2012).

3 Installation

3.1 All users
   When you are reading this and find the R package is already available in the Bioconductor
   package repository. You can install it directly from the Bioconductor.
      --Windows users: select the menu "Packages" and then click "install R
        package(s)..." and then look for the package flowPeaks
      --Linux users: type the following after you have invoked R
         > source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
         > biocLite("flowPeaks")

    If this succeeds, congratulations.

3.2 If the package is not available on the bioconductor, you need to build it from the source,
    please see the vignette pdf file (inst/doc/flowPeaks.pdf) section 3.2 (windows users) and 
    3.3 (Linux users) for the details.
